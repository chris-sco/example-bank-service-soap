# example-bank-service-soap
This is an example application built as part of the process of learning
the Spring Boot Web Service module, as well as more general investigation of
developing SOAP web services.

This app does nothing that achieves anything and is for learning purposes only.

### Project Startup
Nothing fancy. Clone this repository locally and run gradle build; requires
JDK11.
